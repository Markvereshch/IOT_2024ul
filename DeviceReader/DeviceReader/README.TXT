!!!!!About the "connectionStrings.txt" file:
Every connection string must be on a separate line. Example:
------------------------------------------------------------
connectionStringA
connectionStringB
connectionStringC
------------------------------------------------------------
You may have more connection strings than the devices in your factory.
But the file must contain at least the same number of connection lines as the number of devices in the factory.
